#### Add symlinks to Home Directory

* Vim Pathogen needs to be manually added to the autoload directory after
  running Bork on a fresh install
* Add symlinks in $HOME for .vimrc, .zshrc, .tmux.conf, .irbrc
* Using [mattly/bork](https://github.com/mattly/bork) to run the install files
  for brew casks from caskroom.io
* May need to manually install `brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask` before
  running apps.sh
